# Quora Lite

As the name suggests, Quora Lite is a minified version of [Quora.com](https://www.quora.com).

It allows users to create an account, post a question, add answers to pending questions, write a blog post, read blog posts made by others. Posts are text based. Functionality to allow a better editor for creating posts will be added soon.

The website is created using Python and Django. The frontend is pure Bootstrap. The project has been deployed using [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud). I will be switching my database from SQLite to [IBM's BD2](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2) on Cloud soon.

## Disclaimer
No copyright infringement intended. The Quora logo and the Quora name are most probably intellectual prooerties of Adam D'Angelo who owns Quora, Mountain View, California.

The use of the Quora name in the project has no intension of claiming any ownership of Quora in any way. I just made use of it so that I wont have to explain to everyone what this website does and when i say its a mini Quora.com people just automatically undertand what I mean.

 Please dont sue me.
