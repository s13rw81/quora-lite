# Quora Lite
As the name suggests, Quora Lite is a minified version of [Quora.com](https://www.quora.com).

It allows users to create an account, post a question, add answers to pending questions, write a blog post, read blog posts made by others. Posts are text based. Functionality to allow a better editor for creating posts will be added soon.

The website is created using Python and Django. The frontend is pure Bootstrap. The project has been deployed using [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud). I will be switching my database from SQLite to [IBM's BD2](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2) on Cloud soon.
